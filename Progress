- Create git to track the project
- Worked on ingestion agent
Key learning:
- Use absolute path when specifying the file path to retrieve csv or excel file
- Need better prompting/tool so agent only use pandas
- Need to think about the AgentState

## 2026-01-02
- Defined the following agent: planner, schema_answer, codegen, executor, interpreter
- Build a simple workflow that can answer basic question regarding the data
- Need to think about memory: persistent variables etc
- Right now routing logic is simple one flow conversation, need more iterative routing logic
- Try generating graphs (graphing agent maybe?)

## 2026-01-07
- The system now have a basic streamlit frontend that handles file uploading functionality
- Need to connect the existing nodes to fronend
- Need to introduce multiple tabs and figure out how to print debug message in the debug tab properly
- Key learning: no need to worry about long-term memory for now instead ensure context persist over long single runs.

## 2026-01-08
- The system now has multiple tab and hooked to the backend flow with tracing
- Tracing error, something about AgentState not being called properly 

## 2026-01-09
- The system now perform the basic structure of the intended app with all three tabs functioning
- Things to test: multi turn conversations, consistency of response, add higher capability (generate charts and graph)

## 2026-01-10
- The system now can create plots and graphs
- Need to work on specifiying path of the graph
- Add more packages like seaborn to make graph look nice & multi lingual support
- Intepreting the graph (more advanced)
- Storing variable between turns. This enable user to modify graph. Context of agent output is somehow stored and carry forward (more advanced)
